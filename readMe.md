## Creating Methods by Pattern

With this program, it is a "Recursive" method without looping, which obeys the following rule according to the N value received from the user in Java language.

# Rule : 
Subtract 5 from the entered number up to where the entered number is 0 or negative. Writes the last value to the screen during each subtraction. Add 5 again after the number is negative or 0. Again, in each addition operation, the last value of the number is written to the screen.

### N number : 16
### Output : 16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
